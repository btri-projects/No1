## Welcome to the page for project No 1 

Here is where the open source code for this project will live. You're invited to contribute.

No 1 will look into the following areas:

* Analyze: We take an anlytic approach to find out where technology stands currently and what shortcomings prevent the use for broader real-economy applications.

* Find new approaches: Based on our analysis and requirements of our sponsors, we indicate what steps can be taken to make blockchain technology usable.

* Identify attractive real-economy usecases: We outline real-economy usecases which provide a high level of attractiveness and potential.
